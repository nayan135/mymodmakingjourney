# Texture Files for Nayan Items

To complete the implementation of the nayan1 and nayan2 items, you need to create the following texture files:

1. `nayan1.png` - Copy of `nayan.png`
2. `nayan2.png` - Copy of `nayan.png`

These files should be placed in this directory.

The `raw_nayan.png` file can be removed as it's no longer used in the mod.
